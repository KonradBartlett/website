                    <p>
                        I am the full time web developer for <a href="https://www.lttstore.com">LTTStore.com</a>, based out of Surrey BC.
                        Very passionate about bicycles.
                        Cutest bird in the world
                        
//                         I am a full time web developer based out of Surrey BC, 
//                         with 3 years of professional experience working on enterprise applications, and client facing interfaces. 
//                         I tend to work using the hype beast stack of React, Node, and Postgres, because I find these technologies to be the most enjoyable to work with. 
//                         <br/><br/>
//                         While most of my hobbies include sitting in front of a computer, (video games, and coding) I always try to find time during the day to take my bike out and ride for a few hours. 
//                         Seeking out the latest and greatest cutting edge technologies, I love getting myself deeply invested in learning more about new novel topics. 
//                         Lately learning all about AI and data science has been very fun as I listen to as many podcasts and do as many online tutorials as I can. 
//                         <br/><br/>
//                         Experiencing art is very fun, and I try to seek it out as of it much as possible whether it be audio, visual, or any other sort of art. 
//                         I am starting to take steps towards teaching myself the basics of art and illustrations. 
//                         One day I hope to make digital picture books using Three.JS and Canvas. 
//                         <br/><br/>
//                         I do enjoy pi√±a coladas, and getting caught in the rain. <Cocktail/>
